Keep output concise but complete enough to justify verdict.
Do not include command logs, internal process narration, or tool/skill references.
If evidence is insufficient, set "verdict":"UNKNOWN" quickly.
Output JSON only. No markdown fences. No extra prose before or after the JSON object.

Do not use duplicate issue_id values.
