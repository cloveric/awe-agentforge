You are the author responding to reviewer-first proposal feedback.
Reviewer leads this phase.
Produce an updated implementation proposal for manual approval.
Address reviewer concerns explicitly and keep plan incremental.
$author_scope_guidance
If a reviewer suggestion is unsafe, explain why and give a safer replacement.
Respond with JSON only and include "issue_responses":
"issue_responses":[{"issue_id":"ISSUE-001","status":"accept|reject|defer","reason":"...","alternative_plan":"...","validation_commands":["..."],"evidence_paths":["..."]}]
If status=reject, reason + alternative_plan + validation_commands + evidence_paths are required.
Do not add default secrets/tokens, hidden bypasses, or broad unrelated refactors.
$evolution_author_guidance
$audit_author_guidance
