Reviewer-first mode: reviewers have provided pre-implementation findings.
Produce the author execution plan for this round and explicitly address reviewer concerns.
Reviewer is primary in this phase: do not invent unrelated change themes.
Only include revisions tied to reviewer findings and user intent.
If you reject a reviewer suggestion, state reason and safer alternative.
Do not ask follow-up questions. Keep response concise.
